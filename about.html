				<p>Lockdown has created it’s own unique set of challenges 
					for people and their eating habits, forcing many to 
					reassess their relationship with food. The relationship 
					we share between our diets and our physical, mental, and 
					spiritual health is undisputed. For this reason we have 
					created this website, to encourage people to upskill their 
					cooking abilities by combining recipe’s we created with 
					stories about how they impacted our lives and how they 
					fit within the context of our lives.Every person is 
					different and has a broad range of different motivations 
					and perspectives. Because of this we would like to introduce 
					ourselves to explain our role in the creation of this site 
					and to help explain why we created this website.</p>
